# BlackJack-ReactJS
Mini BlackJack

Welcome to my mini project !

Let's make a quick introduction on how to setup the project on your desktop:

Tools
- Visual Studio Community 2017
- NodeJS

Steps
1 - Clone the project from Github using HTTPS
2 - In VStudio2017, open an existing project
3 - Inside the project, install ReactJS and the packages
4 - Enjoy ! :)

Details
*  Run on any version of Google Chrome to make easy
*  Run npm install
> more information: 
  * link: https://nodejs.org/en/
  * link: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Run The Project
* npm run build
* run the visual studio project
* don't forget to clear the browser cache

Errors Encounters
* -- Webpack Version needs to be 4.5.0
* -- Babel Packages Check inside your webpack.config.js if you have the following items: core, load, preset-env, react. 
* -- May need to rename the folder if it doesn't work 
    * -> folder BlackJack-ReactJS renamed for Card-Game

Any Questions, feel free to ask me !
Cheers,
Mike
